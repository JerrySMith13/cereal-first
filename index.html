            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>With most liquid-solid combos, the solid is always added first. Consult the following examples.</p>
            <div class="slideshow-container">
                <div class="slide fade">
                    <img src="images/cola.gif" alt="ALDRIC">
                </div>
                <div class="slide fade">
                    <img src="images/ingredients.gif" alt="IS">
                </div>
                <div class="slide fade">
                    <img src="images/watering.gif" alt="RIGHT">
                </div>
                <div class="slide fade">
                    <img src="images/oatmeal.gif" alt="!!!!">
                </div>
                <a class="prev" onclick="plusSlides(-1)">&#10094;</a>
                <a class="next" onclick="plusSlides(1)">&#10095;</a>
            </div>
            <p>As you can see, ALMOST everything involving a liquid and solid sees the liquid poured after the solid is measured out.</p>
            <p>However, cereal is an exception. Geniuses around the world recognize the ingenuity of a Liquid-First Mindset (LFM).</p>
            <p>Consult the following for more exceptions:</p>

            <h2>Exceptions</h2>
                <p>Although this rule is almost universally true, there are a couple of exceptions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>KOOL-AIDÂ® - Kool-Aid powder should ALWAYS be administered second to water.</li>
                    <li>Fish - When releasing a prize bass you have just caught, don't drain the lake before putting the fish back in. The solid can come second.</li>
                    <li>Peanut butter - What?</li>
                    <li>Sugar in a gas tank - This one doesn't matter how full the tank is, just dump and run</li>
                </ul>
